/**
 * TourCard Fix Verification
 * 
 * This file documents the fix for the tour review summary issue.
 * 
 * PROBLEM: Every tour by the same guide showed identical review summaries
 * CAUSE: TourCard was fetching guide's aggregated ratings instead of tour-specific ratings
 * FIX: Changed get_review_summary call to use tour ID and 'tour' type
 * 
 * Key change in TourCard.tsx line ~100:
 * BEFORE:
 *   target_id_param: tourData.creator_id,  // Guide's ID
 *   target_type_param: 'guide'             // Guide's aggregated reviews
 * 
 * AFTER:
 *   target_id_param: tourData.id,          // Tour's ID  
 *   target_type_param: 'tour'              // Tour-specific reviews
 * 
 * This ensures each tour displays its own review summary instead of showing
 * the guide's overall rating across all their tours.
