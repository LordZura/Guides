# Tour Submission Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Manual Timestamp Conflicts** (FIXED)
- **Problem**: TourForm and BookingContext were manually setting `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- **Impact**: Could cause conflicts with database DEFAULT NOW() and triggers
- **Solution**: Removed manual timestamp setting, let database handle automatically

### 2. **Missing 'offered' Status in Database** (FIXED) 
- **Problem**: BookingForm tries to set status to 'offered' but database constraint only allows: 'requested', 'accepted', 'declined', 'paid', 'completed', 'cancelled'
- **Impact**: Any booking with 'offered' status would fail to insert
- **Solution**: Created migration `010_add_offered_status_to_bookings.sql` to add 'offered' to allowed statuses

### 3. **Restrictive RLS Policies for Offers** (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Only tourists could create bookings, but guides need to create 'offered' bookings
- **Impact**: Guide offers would be rejected by RLS policies
- **Solution**: Updated RLS policy to allow guides to create 'offered' bookings

### 4. **Improved Error Handling** (ADDED)
- **Enhancement**: Added detailed error logging and validation
- **Benefits**: Better debugging information when submissions fail
- **Features**: 
  - Detailed error messages with hints and details
  - Data type validation before submission
  - Input sanitization and normalization

## Files Modified:

1. `src/components/TourForm.tsx` - Fixed timestamps, improved error handling, added validation
2. `src/contexts/BookingContext.tsx` - Fixed timestamps in booking creation and updates
3. `src/db/migrations/010_add_offered_status_to_bookings.sql` - New migration for 'offered' status

## How to Apply Database Changes:

Run the new migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- From file: src/db/migrations/010_add_offered_status_to_bookings.sql
-- Add 'offered' status to the booking status constraint
-- This allows guides to offer tours to tourists in addition to tourists requesting tours

-- Drop the existing constraint
ALTER TABLE public.bookings DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS bookings_status_check;

-- Add the new constraint with 'offered' status included
ALTER TABLE public.bookings 
ADD CONSTRAINT bookings_status_check 
CHECK (status IN ('requested', 'offered', 'accepted', 'declined', 'paid', 'completed', 'cancelled'));

-- Update the comment to reflect the change
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.bookings.status IS 'Booking status: requested (tourist requests), offered (guide offers), accepted, declined, paid, completed, cancelled';

-- Add policy for guides to create offer bookings
-- Drop existing restrictive policies and recreate them to be more flexible
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Tourists can create bookings" ON public.bookings;

-- New policy allows both tourists to request and guides to offer
CREATE POLICY "Users can create bookings" 
  ON public.bookings 
  FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (
    (auth.uid() = tourist_id AND status = 'requested') OR
    (auth.uid() = guide_id AND status = 'offered')
  );
```

## Testing the Fixes:

1. Try creating a tour as a guide
2. Try submitting a booking request as a tourist  
3. Try creating an offer as a guide to a tourist
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages if any issues occur

These changes should resolve the submission errors you were experiencing.
