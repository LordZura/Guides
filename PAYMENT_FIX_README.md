# Booking Payment Issue Fix

## Problem
Users experiencing payment failures with errors:
- **400 status errors** when updating bookings to 'paid' status (e.g., booking `3a3063ec-006a-4ae3-b82b-ee2c5039c5b9`)
- "Error updating booking - Tourist is not allowed to perform this update"
- "Payment status update failed - Your payment was processed, but updating the booking status failed"

## Root Cause
The 400 errors can occur due to:
1. Row Level Security (RLS) policies being too restrictive
2. Transient RLS policy evaluation issues 
3. Temporary database constraint conflicts
4. Network timing issues during database operations

## Solution
1. **Database Migration**: Updated RLS policies to allow proper access (if needed)
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Implemented robust retry logic for booking updates
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Added better debugging and user-friendly error messages

## Implementation Details

### Retry Mechanism
- Added `retryBookingUpdate` function in `src/utils/supabaseRetry.ts`
- Retries 400 errors specifically for booking operations (in addition to network errors)
- Uses exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- Maximum 3 retry attempts before failing

### Code Changes
- Enhanced `BookingContext.tsx` with retry logic for status updates
- Maintains all existing error logging and user feedback
- Preserves backward compatibility

## Database Migration Required (if RLS policies need updates)

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Execute the contents of: src/db/migrations/012_fix_booking_update_policies.sql
```

The migration simplifies the RLS policies to:
- Allow tourists to update their own bookings (for payment)
- Allow guides to update bookings for their tours
- Remove overly complex constraints that were blocking legitimate updates

## Code Changes
- Enhanced error handling in `BookingContext.tsx` with retry mechanism and better logging
- Added `retryBookingUpdate` function in `supabaseRetry.ts` for robust error handling
- Implemented exponential backoff retry for 400 errors in booking operations
- More specific error messages for RLS policy violations
- Additional debugging information for troubleshooting

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Apply the database migration (if RLS policies need updates)
2. Create a booking as a tourist
3. Have the guide accept it
4. Try to pay for the booking as a tourist
5. Verify the payment status updates successfully (with automatic retry if needed)

## Monitoring
The retry mechanism includes detailed logging:
- Each retry attempt is logged with attempt number and delay
- Final success/failure is logged with full error context
- Easy to monitor retry patterns in application logs
